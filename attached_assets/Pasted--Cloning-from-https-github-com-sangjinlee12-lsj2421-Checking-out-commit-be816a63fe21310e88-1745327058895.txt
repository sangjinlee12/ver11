INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of flask-sqlalchemy to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 3), -r requirements.txt (line 4) and Flask==2.2.3 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested Flask==2.2.3
    flask-login 0.6.3 depends on Flask>=1.0.4
    flask-sqlalchemy 3.1.1 depends on flask>=2.2.5
To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict
ERROR: ResolutionImpossible: for help visit https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/dependency-resolution/#dealing-with-dependency-conflicts
[notice] A new release of pip is available: 24.0 -> 25.0.1
[notice] To update, run: pip install --upgrade pip
